<p2style="background-color:Gray;"style="color:red;">In this class I am excited to learn about HTML and other sources of web editing and developing software and technology. I believe this will be very usefull to me in the future and I am happy to learn it. As I already have a background in coding I believe im going to do well and excel in this class. I plan to as the class developes do some of my own learning out of class on other sources of web developement and languages we might not be using inside of the class!</p2>
